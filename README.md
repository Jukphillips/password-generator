## User Story

The user clicks "generate password" button and is then asked to give criteria on what they would like to include in their generated password. First they recieve a prompt asking them to enter a number value between 8 and 128 in length. This will determine how long their password will be. If they enter anything other than a number, a number less than 8 or greater than 128, then the system will alert the user to re-enter a vaild input until they do. Next they are prompted with four confirms. Confirm if they want lowercase leters, uppercase letters, numeric characters, and/or special characters respectively. The user must choose one of the four or the system will create an alert asking them to "please choose at least one character type!" Once they enter in they're criteria, the application takes in that information and creates a password that includes said criteria.
